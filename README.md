# FlutterMind 🤖

**An open-source AI robot powered entirely by your smartphone.**

> Build a 3D printed humanoid robot arm that thinks, sees, and responds to voice — using only your Android phone as the brain, a USB-C cable, and ~₹7,000 in parts.

## What is FlutterMind?

FlutterMind is a fully open-source robotic skeleton controlled by a Flutter app running on your Android phone. The phone connects to an Arduino motor controller via a USB-C OTG cable, which drives 22 servo motors across a 3D printed humanoid upper body.

The phone is not just a remote — it **is** the brain. Gemma 4 E2B runs directly on the phone's processor. No cloud. No Raspberry Pi. No laptop.

## Why FlutterMind?

Every existing open-source robot (InMoov, pib, Berkeley Humanoid Lite) requires a Raspberry Pi, a PC, or a cloud API as the brain. FlutterMind eliminates all of that.

| Feature | InMoov | pib | FlutterMind |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brain | PC | Raspberry Pi | **Android phone** |
| AI | Cloud API | Cloud API | **On-device, offline** |
| Control app | Generic | Generic | **Custom Flutter app** |
| Vision + voice | Separate modules | Separate modules | **One model (Gemma 4)** |
| Cost | ~₹15,000+ | ~₹20,000+ | **~₹7,000** |
| Works offline | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Demo

> 📹 _Video coming in Phase 2 — contribute your build videos!_

**Gesture demo:** Voice command `"pick up the bottle"` → Gemma 4 decides `GRIP` → Arduino moves all 5 finger servos → hand closes.

**Vision demo:** Phone camera sees a red ball → Gemma 4 describes it → robot points toward it.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never power servos from the Arduino 5V pin — they draw too much current. Always use a separate power bank.

## 3D Printing

FlutterMind uses modified [InMoov](https://inmoov.fr) STL files as the base skeleton. InMoov is an open-source, fully 3D printable humanoid robot by Gaël Langevin.

### Print settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Material | PLA |
| Infill | 30% |
| Layer height | 0.2mm |
| Supports | Yes (arm joints) |
| Nozzle | 0.4mm |

### Build order

Start with the hand — it's the most satisfying and lets you test the full pipeline early.

```
Week 1: Right hand (finger segments, knuckles, palm housing)
Week 2: Right forearm + elbow joint
Week 3: Right upper arm + shoulder bracket
Week 4: Left arm (mirror of right)
Week 5: Torso cage + phone/Arduino mount
Week 6: Head shell (camera + mic cutouts)
```

STL files are in the `/stl` folder of this repo. See [PRINTING.md](docs/PRINTING.md) for detailed instructions.

## Software

### Requirements

- Android phone (Android 10+, 4GB+ RAM recommended)
- Flutter 3.x / Dart 3.x
- Arduino IDE 2.x
- Gemma 4 E2B model (downloaded on-device)

## Getting Started

### 1. Flash Arduino firmware

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/adhnan-e/fluttermind.git
cd fluttermind

# Open in Arduino IDE
# Flash arduino/upper_body/upper_body.ino to Arduino #1
# Flash arduino/lower_body/lower_body.ino to Arduino #2
```

### 2. Set up Flutter app

```bash
cd app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app will detect your Arduino automatically when connected via USB-C OTG.

### 3. Set up Gemma 4 on-device

The app uses Google's [LiteRT (formerly TensorFlow Lite) LLM Inference SDK](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert) to run **Gemma 4 E2B** directly on the phone. On first launch, it will prompt you to download the pre-compiled [gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm](https://huggingface.co/litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm) model file (~2.5GB). Requires Wi-Fi for the initial download only — after that, everything runs offline.

### 4. Connect and test

```
1. Connect USB-C OTG cable from phone to Arduino
2. Open FlutterMind app
3. Tap "Connect" — should show green USB status
4. Try a quick gesture: tap "Open Hand"
5. Try voice: hold the mic button → say "wave hello"
```

---

## Flutter App Features

| Screen | Description |
|---|---|
| Manual control | Individual sliders for all 22 joints |
| Gesture presets | One-tap: Open, Grip, Point, Pinch, Wave, Thumbs up |
| AI mode | Hold mic → speak → Gemma 4 decides the action |
| Vision mode | Phone camera → Gemma 4 sees and reacts in real time |
| Pose recorder | Save and replay custom joint angle sequences |

---

## AI Training (Optional)

The default model is Gemma 4 E2B with a robot-specific system prompt — this works well out of the box.

For better performance on your specific robot and environment, you can fine-tune using the [Indoor Robot Navigation Dataset (IRND)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/narayananpp/indoor-robot-navigation-dataset-irnd).

```bash
cd ai

# 1. Download IRND dataset from Kaggle
kaggle datasets download -d narayananpp/indoor-robot-navigation-dataset-irnd

# 2. Convert CSV to Gemma 4 training format
python prepare_dataset.py

# 3. Fine-tune on Google Colab (free T4 GPU)
# Upload fine_tune.py to Colab and run
# Takes ~2-3 hours

# 4. Export to GGUF and deploy via Ollama
# See docs/AI_TRAINING.md for full walkthrough
```

---

## Serial Protocol

The Flutter app communicates with Arduino using a simple newline-delimited text protocol over USB serial at 115200 baud.

```
# Single joint control
JOINT:R_ELBOW:90\n          → set right elbow to 90°

# Named gesture
GESTURE:WAVE\n              → trigger wave sequence

# Fine finger control
JOINT:R_INDEX:160\n         → curl right index finger

# Emergency stop
STOP\n                      → all servos to rest position

# Arduino replies
ACK:JOINT:R_ELBOW:90\n      → confirm command received
ERR:UNKNOWN_CMD\n           → unknown command
```
